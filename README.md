# Image Description Transformer for Student Work

## Description:
This project integrates a Vision Transformer (ViT) with a traditional Transformer architecture to process visual data from images of student work. The goal is to understand and generate textual descriptions or feedback on the presented student material, serving as an assistive tool for educators in understanding and assessing student submissions.

## Model Performance:

- **Epoch 31**: 
  - Loss: 1.4237
  - Training Accuracy: 66.58%
  - Validation Accuracy: 54.92%

- **Epoch 50**: 
  - Training Accuracy: 83.98%
  - Validation Accuracy: 56.63%

Despite the marked improvement from epoch 31 to 50, the minor increment in validation accuracy compared to the training accuracy indicates potential overfitting.

## Approach:
The model harnesses the self-attention mechanism of transformers not only for sequence data but also for visual data. This combination aids in the detailed analysis of student work images, extracting nuances and critical features that can be translated into descriptive text.


## Rationale:
In the modern digital classroom, educators are increasingly turning to tools that can help them navigate and assess student submissions. This model is a novel attempt to leverage AI in bridging the gap between visual student work and textual feedback.

## Potential Shortcomings:
1. **Complexity**: : Both Vision Transformers and traditional Transformers have a large number of parameters. When combined, this might lead to increased computational requirements, making it less feasible for real-time applications or on devices with limited resources.
2. **Overfitting**: With the increased model capacity, there's a risk of overfitting, especially if the training data is limited
3. **Computational Demands**: Integrated transformer architectures are computationally intensive.
4. **Masking Efficiency**: The use of masks for padding might not be the most resource-efficient way to handle variable-length sequences.

## Potential Improvements:
1. **Regularization**: Implement techniques such as Data Augmentation or reduce the model capacity to reduce overfitting.
2. **Optimized Mask Handling**: Research and implement more efficient methods for handling variable-length sequences without relying heavily on masks.

## Conclusion:
While promising in its potential to revolutionize how educators interact with student submissions, this model requires further refinements to be optimally effective and efficient. Exploring alternative methods for sequence padding and Implement techniques to reduce overfitting can significantly enhance its utility.
